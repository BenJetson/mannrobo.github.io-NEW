# mannrobo.github.io

This repository contains the website for our club.

Our awesome website is currently under construction, which is to replace our not-so-nice site over at Google Sites [here](http://sites.greenvilleschools.us/mannrobotics). Our new site will look much better, work better for our needs, and be further optimized for use on a wide variety of devices. As our club grows, the site will continue to evolve to meet our needs. 

## Development Progress

You can track the progress of site development live over on our [Waffle.io board](https://waffle.io/mannrobo/mannrobo.github.io/) or on our GitHub repository [issue tracker](https://github.com/mannrobo/mannrobo.github.io/issues) and [milestone tracker](https://github.com/mannrobo/mannrobo.github.io/milestones).

## Why so many different chamges?

Our site has evolved a lot over the course of the past year. We originally started the site over on Google Sites during the VRC Skyrise game season to keep members up-to-date on what we were doing. The site looked really gross (thanks to the really bad templates and lack of custom HTML support) and didn't respond to mobile devices. We 'refreshed' the Google site at the end of the 'Nothing But Net' game season, but that still wasn't enough to make the site really usable. Then, we decided to move our site here to GitHub pages. With proper support for the latest web technologies and the ability to write our own code, we've been able to supercharge the experience available to end-users. We expect more changes to occur as our club grows and our needs change.  

## Need help?

If you experience an issue with the site or have a request, check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/mannrobo/mannrobo.github.io/issues/) to see if someone else has already reported the same issue. If someone else has already reported your issue, [leave a comment](https://help.github.com/articles/discussing-projects-in-issues-and-pull-requests/) on the issue so we'll have more data to work with when we go to fix the problem. If no one else has yet to report your problem, you can report it yourself by [submitting a ticket](https://github.com/mannrobo/mannrobo.github.io/issues/new) to GitHub (note that tickets are public). 

Club members who need immediate support can reach our club's administration team directly via Remind101. If the matter is not urgent, please follow the protocol above.

Eventually, once our site is futher along in development and the UX is finalized, help will be integrated into the site. However, in the meantime we'll have some basic documentation over at our [wiki](https://github.com/mannrobo/mannrobo.github.io/wiki) (coming soon!).
